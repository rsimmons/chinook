# Chinook (*experimental*)

Chinook lets you write reactive/dataflow/[FRP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_reactive_programming) style programs in Javascript using an API similar to [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html). Compared to React, Chinook is more general purpose and in some ways simpler; it is not tied to any notion of a UI tree or components.

[Check out a demo](https://rsimmons.github.io/chinook/) with a few live example programs.

## In Comparison to React

No knoweldge of React is required to understand Chinook, and Chinook does not use React in any way. But if you're already familiar with React ([React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) in particular) then it might be useful to analogize Chinook in terms of React concepts.
